# Diabetes Prediction

## Description
This repository focuses on predicting the onset of diabetes in patients using linear regression implemented from scratch, without making use of any library functions. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a patient developing diabetes based on various input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets, which is a publicly available dataset often used for diabetes prediction tasks. It contains information about patients and includes features such as the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, age, and whether the patient developed diabetes within five years. 

## Approach
The project involves the following steps:
1. Loading and preprocessing the diabetes dataset.
2. Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
3. Implementing linear regression from scratch without using any library functions.
4. Model training and evaluation using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
5. Analysis of model performance and interpretation of the regression coefficients.
6. Visualization of the data and regression line to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable.

## Usage
1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kajolshah310/diabetes_prediction.git
```
2) Open the diabetes_linear_regression.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE.

3) Install the required packages and dependencies mentioned in the notebook, if necessary.

4) Execute the code and follow along with the implementation of the diabetes prediction using linear regression.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms or techniques, or explore additional approaches to improve the prediction accuracy.
